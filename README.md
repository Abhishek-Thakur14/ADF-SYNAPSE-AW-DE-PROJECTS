# Adventure Works - End-to-End Data Engineering Project using Azure 🚀

## Overview 🌍
The **Adventure Works** project is a modern **end-to-end data engineering solution** built using **Microsoft Azure**. It demonstrates how to design and implement a scalable **Data Lakehouse architecture** for efficient data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analytics.

This project processes raw data from multiple sources, transforms it into structured data, and enables **business intelligence insights** using **Azure Synapse Analytics** and **Power BI**.

---
## 📌 Key Objectives
- Build a scalable **Data Lakehouse** for handling structured and unstructured data.
- Implement **ETL pipelines** for data ingestion, transformation, and loading.
- Optimize **big data processing** using **Azure Databricks** (Apache Spark & PySpark).
- Ensure data reliability and efficient storage using **Delta Lake**.
- Create a **Data Warehouse** in **Azure Synapse Analytics** for structured querying.
- Use **Power BI** for data visualization and business intelligence.

## 📂 Data Pipeline Architecture
### 🔹 **Data Ingestion**
- Data is sourced from **CSV, JSON, and Parquet files**.
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** loads data into **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2)**.

### 🔹 **Data Processing & Transformation**
- **Azure Databricks** (PySpark) processes raw data, handles missing values, and optimizes tables.
- **Delta Lake** ensures **ACID compliance**, data reliability, and versioning.

### 🔹 **Data Warehousing**
- Processed data is stored in **Azure Synapse Analytics**.
- **External tables** and **OPENROWSET** allow querying raw data directly from **ADLS Gen2**.

### 🔹 **Data Visualization & Analytics**
- **Power BI** connects to **Synapse Analytics** to build insightful **dashboards and reports**.
